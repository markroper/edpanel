His quiz average (86%) shows that he understands ideas in the short term, but off-task behavior in class and lack of effort on homework, including test corrections, leads to low overall understanding; test average (68%), class work average (78%), and homework average (60%). In quarter 2, Kevin needs to focus on note taking and partner work during class so that he is prepared for homework and assessments. Higher engagement in class will lead to better understanding and more confidence.","actualscoreentered":"","lastupdated":"2015-11-04","pointsearned":"","id":"435925"}}},{"id":435926,"tables":{"psm_finalscore":{"potentialvarcreditvalue":"","commentcode":"","manualoverride":"0","variablecreditvalue":"","reportingtermid":"125966","outofdate":"0","pointspossible":"","lettergrade":"C","score":"72.68","sectionenrollmentid":"298376","commentvalue":"","actualscoreentered":"","lastupdated":"2015-11-03","pointsearned":"","id":"435926"}}},{"id":435927,"tables":{"psm_finalscore":{"potentialvarcreditvalue":"","commentcode":"","manualoverride":"0","variablecreditvalue":"","reportingtermid":"125968","outofdate":"0","pointspossible":"","lettergrade":"C","score":"71.73","sectionenrollmentid":"298376","commentvalue":"Kevin continues to miss his potential in Algebra. He is frequently distracted in class during note taking and independent, partner, or group work (class work average 78%). This leaves Kevin with low understanding and incomplete resources for homework practice and studying for assessments (quiz average 61%, test average 72%, and homework average 69%). In quarter 3, Kevin needs to invest more energy in taking detailed and complete notes and asking questions when he is unsure, so that he is building understanding and feels more prepared for assignments.","actualscoreentered":"","lastupdated":"2016-01-26","pointsearned":"","id":"435927"}}},{"id":435928,"tables":{"psm_finalscore":{"potentialvarcreditvalue":"","commentcode":"","manualoverride":"0","variablecreditvalue":"","reportingtermid":"125972","outofdate":"0","pointspossible":"","lettergrade":"C","score":"72.21","sectionenrollmentid":"298376","commentvalue":"","actualscoreentered":"","lastupdated":"2016-01-25","pointsearned":"","id":"435928"}}},{"id":435929,"tables":{"psm_finalscore":{"potentialvarcreditvalue":"","commentcode":"","manualoverride":"0","variablecreditvalue":"","reportingtermid":"125976","outofdate":"0","pointspossible":"","lettergrade":"B","score":"81.63","sectionenrollmentid":"298376","commentvalue":"","actualscoreentered":"","lastupdated":"2016-03-30","pointsearned":"","id":"435929"}}},{"id":435930,"tables":{"psm_finalscore":{"potentialvarcreditvalue":"","commentcode":"","manualoverride":"0","variablecreditvalue":"","reportingtermid":"125978","outofdate":"0","pointspossible":"","lettergrade":"C","score":"75.35","sectionenrollmentid":"298376","commentvalue":"","actualscoreentered":"","lastupdated":"2016-03-30","pointsearned":"","id":"435930"}}},{"id":435931,"tables":{"psm_finalscore":{"potentialvarcreditvalue":"","commentcode":"","manualoverride":"0","variablecreditvalue":"","reportingtermid":"125981","outofdate":"0","pointspossible":"","lettergrade":"","score":"","sectionenrollmentid":"298376","commentvalue":"","actualscoreentered":"","lastupdated":"2015-09-05","pointsearned":"","id":"435931"}}},{"id":435932,"tables":{"psm_finalscore":{"potentialvarcreditvalue":"","commentcode":"","manualoverride":"0","variablecreditvalue":"","reportingtermid":"125985","outofdate":"0","pointspossible":"","lettergrade":"C","score":"75.35","sectionenrollmentid":"298376","commentvalue":"","actualscoreentered":"","lastupdated":"2016-03-30","pointsearned":"","id":"435932"}}},{"id":435933,"tables":{"psm_finalscore":{"potentialvarcreditvalue":"","commentcode":"","manualoverride":"0","variablecreditvalue":"","reportingtermid":"125988","outofdate":"0","pointspossible":"","lettergrade":"","score":"","sectionenrollmentid":"298376","commentvalue":"","actualscoreentered":"","lastupdated":"2015-11-03","pointsearned":"","id":"435933"}}},{"id":435934,"tables":{"psm_finalscore":{"potentialvarcreditvalue":"","commentcode":"","manualoverride":"0","variablecreditvalue":"","reportingtermid":"125990","outofdate":"0","pointspossible":"","lettergrade":"C","score":"75.35","sectionenrollmentid":"298376","commentvalue":"","actualscoreentered":"","lastupdated":"2016-03-30","pointsearned":"","id":"435934"}}}]}
