Also expressed concern over bus issue of kids being dropped off up the street.  The grandfather just had surgery and it has been extremely difficult for him to get her.  All sorts of safety concerns.  It is baffling to me why Coppola can't do a drop off outside Hunter's Run/Steeplechase court.  I have see the bus go down past that entrance after dropping the kids off and turning around in the Chuncky's parking lot.
